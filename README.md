# myNvim

This is my Configuration of Nvim for using it at 42 Heilbronn

## What dependencies are needed to run it on your 42 Session?

In most cases, while using nvim on your personal Workstation running on Linux, the only dependencies you need are Python and npm.
(look at the installation guide of Lunar-Vim)
